## Dataset

The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and pattern recognition. The goal is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower based on its four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

There are three species in the dataset:

Iris setosa

Iris versicolor

Iris virginica



## Model

Several machine learning algorithms can be used to solve the Iris flower classification problem, Here I have used 
- Decision tree
- Support Vector
- Random Forest Regression
- K-Means Clustering


## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is available and properly formatted. 
5. Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
6. Train the model: Utilize a classification algorithm such as Decision tree to build a model .
7. Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as precision, confusion matrix, and acurracy to assess the model's performance.
8. Make predictions: Deploy the trained model to make predictions.

Update the main script and documentation accordingly, incorporating any changes made during the development process.

## Evaluation

The performance of the  model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Recall**
- **f1-score**

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

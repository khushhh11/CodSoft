# Credit Card Fraud Detection

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, helping financial institutions and cardholders prevent unauthorized transactions and reduce financial losses.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle , containing historical credit card transactions. It is a highly imbalanced dataset, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions. The dataset consists of features such as transaction amount, time etc.


## Model

Various machine learning algorithms can be explored for fraud detection, including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Here, I have used Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is available and properly formatted. 
5. Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
6. Train the model: Utilize a classification algorithm such as logistic regression or random forests to build the  model.
7. Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as precision, confusion matrix, and acurracy to assess the model's performance.
8. Make predictions: Deploy the trained model to make predictions.

Update the main script and documentation accordingly, incorporating any changes made during the development process.

## Evaluation

The performance of the Credit Card Fraud Detection  model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics include:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Confusion Matrix**
